#Discogrid
## A GLobal Artist Discovery App

##Technology Stack
- Node
- Express
- Angular

##Summary
Discgrid allows a user to enter a country of interest, which then send a query to the Echonest API for a random artist from that country, along with where they're from, a brief summary and link to the full biography, recent blog posts about that artist as well as a grid of videos about that artist. 

The intention was to create to an application that in these tumultous times of global unrest, can drive awarness of the good in people around th world, and help bring people just a little bit closer together through music. 

##Additional Features
As part of the evolution of this aplication, I would like to add:
- An in-app playlist that is generated around the random artist that is selected, most likely using the Spotify API
- A video player, as opposed to links
- a map madal, where users can search by clicking on the image of a country


Thanks for taking the time.
